# Notes: Gene-exercise interactions in the development of cardiometabolic diseases

## Intro

- According to the authors: "A number of twin studies have demonstrated that the strength of the genetic factor contribution to cardiometabolic diseases is comparable to that of environmental factors 11-16)."


## Heritability

- A number of twin studies have demonstrated that the heritability of cardiometabolic diseases/traits is approxi- mately 20 - 80% 11-16). For example, large-scale twin studies demonstrated that the heritability of type 2 diabetes was approximately 48% for men and 38% for women 12), whereas the heritability of coronary heart disease was 57% for men and 38% for women 15. 


## Identification of variants

- Because complex diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases, are highly prevalent in general populations, GWASs of complex diseases have been conducted nder the hypothesis that common SNPs with a low allele frequency ≥ 5% are associated with susceptibility to common diseases (the so-called “common disease-common variant” hypothesis) 31).

- An important thing to note is that even the most significant SNPs have a relatively small effect on the development of cardiometabolic diseases and associated risk factors. For example, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.4 for the risk allele rs7903146 of TCF7L2, which is the most strongly associated SNP with type 2 diabe

- However, several studies have reported that the genetic risk score (GRS, alternatively called e.g. genotype score, genetic predisposition score), calculated from the additive number of risk alleles of GWAS-derived SNPs, increases the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. An score for diabetes in Japanese showed that an increase of a risk allele resulted in an average increase in the OR of 1.29, and the OR for subjects with 14 - 18 risk alleles exceeded 11 (OR de 11!!) relative to individuals with 0 - 6 risk alleles 32) . Thus, the accumulation of risk alleles of the GWAS-derived SNPs can well predict cardiometabolic diseases, although prediction is difficult using a single genetic variant.


## Rare genetic variants

- Although GWAS have successfully identified the num- ber of common SNPs responsible for complex diseases, the variation of the susceptibility to complex diseases due to genetic factors is not fully explained by these SNPs 33) . This problem is the so-called “missing heritability,” and researchers have been exploring other types of genetic variations such as rare variants (mutations) in the protein- coding exon regions.

- recent rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled us to determine individua whole genome sequences 35) and have revealed that eve the people without severe monogenic diseases posses a large number of deleterious mutations with low allel frequency <1% 36) .

- Although whole-genome or exome sequencing using next-generation sequencers is the most powerful strategy to detect individual rare variants, sequencing cost remains too expensive to perform a large-scale association study. 

- As a cost-effective method, an exome SNP array designed from over 12,000 whole genome or exome sequencing data has been widely used. Exome-wide association stud- ies (EWASs) using the exome array have successfully identified low-frequency rare variants associated with cardiometabolic diseases/traits. 

- EWAS have shown associations between low-frequency variants and cardiometabolic traits. On of them with an increase of two fold in liver fat content between variants.

- although recent EWASs have demonstrated that low-frequency variants are associated with risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, a very large sample size is required to detect novel rare variants (MAF < 0.5%) with adequate statistical power


## Physical activity and fitness on health

- An enormous num- ber of studies have demonstrated that the time spent in moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA, ≥3.0 METs) is negatively associated with the incidence of cardiometabolic diseases such as coronary heart dis- ease 7) , stroke 6) , type 2 diabetes 4) , and all-cause mortality 5) .

- Wei et al. also reported that high cardiorespiratory fitness reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases and the development of type 2 diabetes even in obese people 47) , suggesting that the beneficial effects of high cardiorespiratory fitness on car- diometabolic diseases are independent of obesity. In addition to cardiorespiratory fitness, several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an independent association of muscular strength with cardiometabolic diseases and as- sociated risk factors

- Because increased life expectancy was observed in elite endurance athletes 52,53) , high fitness individuals may also have a favorable genetic profile against cardio- metabolic diseases. Therefore, it raises the question of whether genetically low fitness individuals can easily re- ceive the benefit of regular exercise to prevent cardiomet- abolic diseases. 

- Chomistek et al. constructed endurance, muscle strength, and maximal oxygen uptake (V O 2 max) genetic scores from 58 SNPs (18 were previously found to be associated with endurance phenotypes, 12 with muscle strength phenotypes, 2 with both endurance and muscle strength, and 26 with train- ability of V O 2 max) and examined whether the preventive effect of physical activity on the risk of coronary heart disease were modified by these genetic fitness scores. They reported that increased physical activity was associ- ated with a lower incidence of coronary heart diseases, and the hazard ratio of 500 kcal/week of increased physi- cal activity was not modified by any of the fitness genetic scores. This suggests that even individuals with an un- favorable genetic profile for physical fitness can receive the benefit of regular exercise in the prevention of cardio- metabolic diseases.


## Genetics and heterogeneity in response to exercise

- Although there is no doubt that regular exercise ef- fectively prevents cardiometabolic diseases, the question remains whether everyone receives equal benefits from regular exercise.

- The HERITAGE Family Study has demonstrated that the exercise training-induced changes in cardiometabolic traits are heritable. For example, the study revealed that the heritability estimates of exercise training-induced changes in plasma triglycerides and systolic blood pres- sure were 22% and 20%, respectively. Although more than half of the individuals improved their cardiometabolic risk factor after the 20-week aerobic exercise training, a consider- able number of individuals could not receive the benefit of regular exercise, some of which even experienced an adverse cardiometabolic response to exercise training. 

- Recently, GWASs have been applied to the data from the HERITAGE Family Study, and have shown that the top 10 SNPs explained 32% of the variance in the response of plasma triglycerides to regular exercise


## Polygene-exercise interactions in cardiometabolic risk factors

- whether or not exercise can attenuate polygenic predisposition to cardiometa- bolic diseases is of great interest to researchers who have shown that exercise is beneficial for cardiometabolic health.

- Several studies have demonstrated that regular ex- ercise attenuated the cardiometabolic risk associated with single genetic variants 66-72) . However, each SNP has only a small effect as described in the earlier section. It should be examined whether polygenic risk of cardiometabolic disease is diminished in physically active individuals.

- To date, only a limited number of studies have exam- ined the effects of the interaction between polygenic risk and regular exercise on cardiometabolic risk. Li et al. examined whether self-reported daily physical activity modifies the genetic predisposition to increased body mass index (BMI) and obesity risk assessed by construct- ing genetic predisposition scores from 12 SNPs that were identified by a GWAS of a large population-based study consisting of a population of 20,430 UK individuals.

- Their study showed that each additional BMI-increasing allele was associated with an increase of 0.205 kg/m 2 in BMI in the inactive group, but the effect was much less in the active individuals (0.131 kg/m 2 increase per allele, Fig. 2).

- Ahmad et al. attempted to replicate this finding by large-scale meta-analysis consisting of 111,421 individuals from 11 cohorts
of European ancestry 74) . They confirmed significant inter- action between the genetic predisposition score and phys- ical activity on BMI in the entire cohort; however, this in- teraction was observed only when three North American cohorts (n = 39,810) were included in their meta-analysis. They concluded that combining many cohort studies that have measured environmental exposures differently might be relatively inefficient for the detection of gene-exercise interactions.

- the authors have tested whether the number of risk alleles for lipid profile interact with physical fitness, showing that interaction. Their results suggest that high cardiorespiratory fitness attenuates the polygenic risk of hypertriglyceridemia, whereas it may not modify the polygenic risk associated with high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol levels in Japanese men.

- Thus, although previous studies have indicated that physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness possibly attenuate polygenic predisposition to obesity and hyper- triglyceridemia, the polygenic effect on other cardiometa- bolic risk factors is robust, and regular exercise does not likely diminish this effect. Nevertheless, a very limited number of studies focusing on the polygene-exercise in- teractions have been conducted, and studies examining the polygene-exercise interactions in the onset of car- diometabolic diseases have not been carried out


## Gene-aging interactions

- Aging, in addition to genetic factors and exercise, is also an important risk factor for cardiometabolic dis- eases 76) . Twin studies have reported that the heritability of several traits was different between young and elderly twins 11,13,14) , suggesting that aging might modify the con- tribution of genetic and environmental factors.

- aging modifies the strength of the contribution of genetic factors and lifestyle factors to obesity, suggesting that age-specific genetic effects should be considered when researchers perform studies of gene-exercise interactions.

- while we cannot conclude whether regular exercise attenuates polygenic predis- position to cardiometabolic risk factors due to lack of evidence about polygene-exercise interactions. Genome cohort studies measuring physical activity and fitness, as well as exercise intervention studies considering genetic factors in detail, will contribute to the understanding of polygene-exercise interactions in cardiometabolic risk. Because most of the existing genome cohorts were cross- sectional or retrospective design, prospective genome cohort studies evaluating a trend in physical activity and fitness should be conducted to elucidate the role of gene- exercise interactions in the development of cardiometa- bolic diseases.
